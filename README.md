# Drowsiness-detection
The objective of this intermediate Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect if a personâ€™s eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.

How To Run:

1. Download the model4.h5 trained model from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HcH2Nz9R7Rt_QK6DSGvuieSWgKdXZTBY/view?usp=sharing

2. Download the "main.exe" file from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LNITsDSYYrqMR5qtGDE4njKsUV6rvgjF/view?usp=sharing

2. Paste both the files in the Project-Execution folder.

3. Run the main.exe file to start the program.

4. Follow the program intuitively.
